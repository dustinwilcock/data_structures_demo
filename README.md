# Data Structures Demo

We'll use for our purposes the contrived example of a geometry program. Requirements:
* Compute the length of a line segment, given 2 points on the Cartesian coordinate system
* Compute the area of a triangle, given 3 points on the Cartesian coordinate system

There are 3 Python implementations:

 * Simple Data Types

 * Named Tuples (called Structs or Records in other languages)

 * Classes
